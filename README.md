# Movie_Rental_System

A simulation for an automated web based movie rental system that allows users to rent movies online or from a store. It is accessible to all users to retrieve information about a movie but a registration process is required to access other features such as renting movies online. The user can request for movies which arenâ€™t available on the site. The system also provides feedback where customers can send queries or complains.
